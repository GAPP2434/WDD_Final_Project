            <p style = "font-size: 60px;">Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron... honey, my 
                pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid 
                eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and 
                strike fear into your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth 
                touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. I 
                would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to 
                freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. 
                You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. 
                You are even amazing off the court, you're a great 
                husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I 
                forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will 
                one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were 
                the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful 
                face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over 
                the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and 
                its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But 
                a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win 
                your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious 
                king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then 
                allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 
                2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2016 you made history 
                happen. You came back from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it. I 
                was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim 
                these words, "CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!" Not only have you 
                changed the game of basketball and the world forever, but you've 
                eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but 
                still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king,
                 Lebron James.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü´∂üèª</p>
